I'm a student at the **University of Pennsylvania** studying Physics and Electrical Engineering, specializing in circuit design for semiconductor memory technologies and device physics.

My research focuses on ferroelectric diodes for next-generation non-volatile memory, combining fabrication, electrical characterization, and computational modeling to push the boundaries of memory technologies.

Beyond the lab, I work on autonomous systems, machine learning, and hardware-software integration. I love playing tennis, and I'm always down to hit :D
