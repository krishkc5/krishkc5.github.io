I'm a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Pennsylvania**, specializing in device physics and semiconductor memory technologies.

My research focuses on ferroelectric diodes for next-generation non-volatile memory, combining hands-on fabrication, electrical characterization, and computational modeling to push the boundaries of memory tech.

Beyond the lab, I work on **autonomous systems**, **machine learning**, and hardware-software integration—bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical engineering solutions.
